        <p id="mainContentTextTitle">What is Geothermal energy?</p>
        <p id="mainContentText">Geothermal energy is a energy that is used on ground water, natural water or rain water depending on the state you live in the rain water can be illegal due to the state claiming as there own.</p><br>
    </div>


    <div id="mainContentII">
        <h2>How much money can one save on the energy cost?</h2>
        <p class="tabbed">Numbers from the EPA show that homeowners save 30-70% on heating and 20-50% on cooling costs</p>
        <p class="tabbed">by using geothermal heat pumps compared to other conventional systems. This translates to roughly $400 to $1,500 annual savings.<br>
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>How much money is spend to install a geothermal system?</h2>
        <p class="tabbed">The national average cost to install a geothermal heating or cooling system is $7,798</p> 
        <p class="tabbed">Most homeowners spending between $3,422 and $12,362. Including equipment and variable excavation costs.</p> 
        <p class="tabbed">total prices can exceed $20,000. Geothermal heat pumps come in 2 to 6-ton units and average between $3,000 and $8,000.<br></p>
        <br>

        <h2>How long does it take to get a geothermal system installed?</h2>
            <p class="tabbed">The usual amount of time needed to install a horizontal loop configuration, which requires shallow trenches, is a mere one<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or two days. A vertical loop configuration is more at the mercy of ground conditions, but most will take two days, possibly three.<br>
                <p class="tabbed">Geothermal energy is generally considered environmentally friendly and does not cause significant amounts of pollution..<br></p>
        <br>
                <h2>Advantages of Geothermal energy:</h2>



                    <p class="tabbed">Geothermal reservoirs are naturally replenished and therefore renewable (it is not possible to exhaust the resources).</p>
                    <p class="tabbed">Great for heating and cooling – even small households can benefit.</p>
                    <p class="tabbed">Harnessing geothermal energy does not involve any fuels, which means less cost fluctuations and stable electricity prices.</p>
                    <p class="tabbed">Small footprint on land – can be built partially underground.</p>


                <br>

                <h2> Disadvantages of Geothermal energy:</h2>

                    <p class="tabbed">Geothermal power plants can in extreme cases cause earthquakes.</p>
                    <p class="tabbed">There are heavy upfront costs associated with both geothermal power plants and geothermal heating/cooling systems.</p>
                    <p class="tabbed">Very location specific (most resources are simply not cost-competitive).</p>
