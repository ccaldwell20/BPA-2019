 The biggest risk in drinking most water is that of waterborne pathogens. The other problem that you might end up facing is chemicals in the water. Instead of buying expensive commercial filters, build a bio-filter. This simple filtering system is used worldwide to purify water for drinking. A bio-filter works almost the same way that a sewage treatment plant does. Likewise, a bio-filter uses a multi-stage approach to removing impurities and pathogens from the water, so that the water that remains is drinkable. The only difference is that you can make it yourself.

Bio-filters have three separate layers:

    Gravel
    Sand
    Activated charcoal
